## Learning Objectives
- Understanding why Python programming is powerful and versatile.
- Learning how to perform various file operations including opening, writing, and reading files.
- Understanding file cursor manipulation and ensuring proper file closure.
- Mastery of using the `with` statement for file operations.
- Understanding JSON, serialization, and deserialization.
- Converting Python data structures to JSON strings and vice versa.

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpreter/Compiler:** Python 3 (version 3.8.5)
- **Line Endings:** All files should end with a newline character.
- **Shebang:** The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **README:** A `README.md` file at the root of the project directory is mandatory.
- **Code Style:** Use `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) for code formatting.
- **Executable:** All files must be executable.
- **File Length:** The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### Python Test Cases
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Line Endings:** All files should end with a newline character.
- **Test Files:** Place all test files inside a folder named `tests`.
- **File Extension:** Test files should have a `.txt` extension.
- **Execution:** All test cases should be executed using `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.
- **Documentation:** All modules, classes, and functions should have proper documentation.
- **Documentation Check:** A documentation should be a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method.

## Tasks
The project consists of multiple tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of input/output operations in Python. Each task has its own requirements and objectives.

1. **Read File**
   - Function to read a text file and print its content to stdout.

2. **Write to a File**
   - Function to write a string to a text file and return the number of characters written.

3. **Append to a File**
   - Function to append a string to the end of a text file and return the number of characters added.

4. **To JSON String**
   - Function to return the JSON representation of an object (string).

5. **From JSON String to Object**
   - Function to return an object represented by a JSON string.

6. **Save Object to a File**
   - Function to write an object to a text file using a JSON representation.

7. **Create Object from a JSON File**
   - Function to create an object from a JSON file.

8. **Class to JSON**
   - Function to return a dictionary description for JSON serialization of an object.

9. **Student to JSON**
   - Class representing a student with methods to retrieve a dictionary representation.

10. **Student to JSON with Filter**
    - Class representing a student with a method to retrieve a filtered dictionary representation.

11. **Student to Disk and Reload**
    - Class representing a student with methods to save to disk and reload from JSON representation.

12. **Pascal's Triangle**
    - Function to generate Pascal's triangle up to a specified depth.
