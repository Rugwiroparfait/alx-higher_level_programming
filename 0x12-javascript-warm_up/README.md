# JavaScript Warm-up

This project serves as a warm-up to JavaScript programming, focusing on foundational concepts and basic scripting tasks. Below you'll find a series of tasks aimed at solidifying your understanding of JavaScript syntax, control flow, functions, and more.

## Background Context

JavaScript is a versatile programming language widely used for web development, scripting, and creating dynamic content on web pages. In this project, you will primarily focus on scripting tasks to grasp fundamental JavaScript concepts before moving on to more complex applications.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basics of JavaScript programming and its significance
- Run JavaScript scripts and create variables/constants
- Differentiate between var, const, and let
- Recognize and utilize various data types in JavaScript
- Implement control flow using if, if...else statements
- Utilize loops (while, for) and loop control statements (break, continue)
- Define functions and comprehend their usage, including scope
- Work with arithmetic operators and manipulate data structures like dictionaries
- Import files and handle command-line arguments

## Requirements

- Use only editors like vi, vim, or emacs for coding
- All files should be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x)
- Ensure that all files end with a newline character
- The first line of every file must be `#!/usr/bin/node`
- Include a mandatory `README.md` file in the project root folder
- Code should adhere to the semistandard coding style (version 16.x.x) with added semicolons and following the AirBnB style guide
- All files must be executable
- File lengths will be evaluated using the `wc` command

## Installation

To run the scripts, make sure you have Node.js version 14 installed. You can install it using the following commands:

```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Additionally, install the semistandard coding style:

```
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```

## Tasks Overview

Below is a summary of the tasks included in this project:

- **Task 0-12**: Various scripting tasks covering topics like printing messages, handling command-line arguments, basic arithmetic operations, loops, functions, and object manipulation.
- **Task 13**: A script that demonstrates how to export and import functions between files.

For detailed instructions and examples for each task, refer to the corresponding files in the repository.
