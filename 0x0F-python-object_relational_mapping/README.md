# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

## Description

This project explores the concept of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Python, particularly focusing on linking databases and Python using modules like MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy. The project covers various tasks that involve interacting with MySQL databases, executing SQL queries, and working with ORM to abstract database operations into Python code.

## Project Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of ORM, database interaction, and Python programming. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

1. **Get all states**: Script to list all states from a MySQL database.
2. **Filter states**: Script to list states with names starting with a specific letter.
3. **Filter states by user input**: Script to filter states based on user input, preventing SQL injection.
4. **SQL Injection...**: Script to filter states, safeguarded against SQL injection attacks.
5. **Cities by states**: Script to list all cities from a database.
6. **First state model**: Define a State class and instantiate a Base object using SQLAlchemy.
7. **All states via SQLAlchemy**: Script to list all State objects from a database using SQLAlchemy.
8. **First state**: Script to print the first State object from a database.
9. **Contains 'a'**: Script to list State objects containing the letter 'a'.
10. **Get a state**: Script to print the State object with a specified name.
11. **Add a new state**: Script to add a new State object to the database.
12. **Update a state**: Script to update the name of a State object in the database.
13. **Delete states**: Script to delete State objects with names containing the letter 'a'.
14. **Cities in state**: Define a City class and script to print all City objects grouped by state.

## Requirements

- All scripts are written in Python 3.8.5 and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- MySQLdb version 2.0.x and SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x are used for database interaction.
- The pycodestyle tool (version 2.8.*) is used for code style compliance.
- Each script takes appropriate command-line arguments for MySQL username, password, and database name.
- The project directory includes a README.md file providing an overview of the project and task details.

## Usage

To run any script, execute it from the command line with the required arguments. For example:

```bash
./0-select_states.py root root hbtn_0e_0_usa
```

Replace `root`, `root`, and `hbtn_0e_0_usa` with your MySQL username, password, and database name respectively.
