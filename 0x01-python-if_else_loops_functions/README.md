# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Author
RUGWIRO PARFAIT

## Overview
This project contains Python scripts that cover the concepts of if/else statements, loops, and functions. Each script focuses on different aspects of these concepts to help learners understand and practice using them in Python programming.

## Files

1. **0-positive_or_negative.py**
   - Determines if a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.

2. **1-last_digit.py**
   - Prints the last digit of a randomly generated number.

3. **2-print_alphabet.py**
   - Prints the alphabet in lowercase.

4. **3-print_alphabt.py**
   - Prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.

5. **4-print_hexa.py**
   - Prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.

6. **5-print_comb2.py**
   - Prints all possible combinations of two digits.

7. **6-print_comb3.py**
   - Prints all possible combinations of three digits.

8. **7-islower.py**
   - Checks if a given character is lowercase.

9. **8-uppercase.py**
   - Converts all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase.

10. **9-print_last_digit.py**
    - Prints the last digit of a given number.

11. **10-add.py**
    - Adds two integers and returns the result.

12. **11-pow.py**
    - Computes and prints the power of one number to another.

13. **12-fizzbuzz.py**
    - Implements the FizzBuzz game for numbers from 1 to 100.

14. **13-insert_number.c, lists.h**
    - C program and header file that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

## Usage
Each Python script can be executed independently. For the C program, compile it using a C compiler and link it with the provided header file (`lists.h`).

Feel free to explore and use these scripts to enhance your understanding of if/else statements, loops, and functions in Python programming.
