# 0x0C. Python - Almost a Circle

## Overview

This project, "Python - Almost a Circle", is part of the Higher-Level Programming curriculum at ALX. The project focuses on solidifying Python programming concepts, especially object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It involves creating classes and methods to model geometric shapes like rectangles and squares, while also implementing features such as serialization, deserialization, and file I/O.

## Project Details

- **Author:** Rugwiro Parfait
- **Weight:** 1
- **Start Date:** February 8, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** February 13, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** February 12, 2024, 6:00 PM

## Background Context

This project serves as a preparatory exercise for the AirBnB project, which is a significant component of the Higher-Level Programming curriculum. It covers various Python topics including OOP, exceptions, file handling, and testing. Additionally, it delves into more advanced concepts such as serialization, deserialization, and JSON handling.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and implement unit testing in Python.
- Serialize and deserialize Python objects.
- Read and write JSON files.
- Utilize `*args` and `**kwargs` in function definitions.
- Handle named arguments effectively.

## Project Structure

The project involves creating several Python scripts and organizing them as per specific requirements:

- **Python Scripts:** Implement various classes and methods following specific guidelines. All scripts should adhere to PEP 8 style guide and be well-documented.
- **Unit Tests:** Write comprehensive unit tests using the `unittest` module to ensure the correctness of implemented functionalities.
- **File Organization:** Organize test files according to project structure. Tests should cover edge cases to ensure robustness.

## Repository Structure

- **GitHub Repository:** [alx-higher_level_programming](https://github.com/Rugwiroparfait/alx-higher_level_programming)
- **Directory:** 0x0C-python-almost_a_circle

## How to Run

To run the unit tests, execute the following command:

```
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```

You can also run individual test files using:

```
python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py
```

## Requirements

- **Python Version:** Python 3.8.5
- **Supported Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Style Guide:** PEP 8
- **Executable Files:** All scripts should be executable and should start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.

## Note

- All classes, methods, and functions must be thoroughly documented.
- Plagiarism in any form is strictly prohibited and will lead to removal from the program.
